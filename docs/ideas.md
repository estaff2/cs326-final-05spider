Innovative idea: 
	Gym apps is a saturated market, and therefore we needed new innovations or a particular focus that would help our gym app stand out. We tackled this problem by deciding to tailor our app to UMass students specifically, as well as adding a competitive component. The basic setup of our app will allow users to track their workouts and then recommend workouts based on their past workouts. However, this is very generic so we decided to add a public leaderboard to our application of personal records. This will add a fun competitive aspect to the gym and allow users to see themselves move up and down the leaderboard. 
	The app will be UMass specific because when we recommend certain exercises, it will include photos from the UMass rec center of the equipment needed for that exercise, it will also only be open to UMass students. We are considering incorporating a map of the Rec Center into our application so users can easily see where each piece of equipment can be found. We felt that focusing on UMass was a good way to add a uniqueness to our app that otherwise would be missing with a typical gym app. However, the app is still useful for recommandations and tracking even if you don’t workout at the UMass rec center. 

Important Components: 
	The most basic layer of our website is a gym tracking and recommendation system. This means that we will need to give users the ability to write down what workouts they did in the past and keep track of them for future reference. Users will also be able to receive recommendations for what workouts they should do based on what muscle groups they want to target. This recommendation will include pictures of the equipment needed at the UMass rec center, and possibly a video of how to do the exercise. 
	Beyond those basic functions, we will give users the ability to keep track of their personal records for various exercises. These personal records will go into a public leaderboard where users can see the top records and filter by things such as major, year, and goal, providing a competitive aspect to the app. There may also be other parts of the leaderboard, such as the longest gym streak.
