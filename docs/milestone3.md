# Overview:

Our application is an app that provides users with the ability to track their workouts, get specific exercise recommendations, and see how their workouts compare to other members of their community. Tracking and recording workouts is available for logged in users, and it lets them post new workouts with info such as exercises done, reps,sets, and weight used. These workouts are then available for them to view anytime. They can get exercise recommendations by inputting what body parts they want to work, and we will give them exercise they could do. Our workout leaderboard is our most innovative feature. It allows members of the Umass community to see how their workouts compare to other people at Umass, with the option to filter by features such as gender, clubs, major and body part. With all of these features combined into one app, our app is both unique and innovative.

# Authentication 

Users must be created first  with all 7 required input information. Then users are authenticated on the login page with associated username password through postgreSQL. Without user creation and login, users have no access to participate in leaderboard ranking or record workout history.

# Division of labor

**Ethan Stafford** - Responsible for all html/js/css/server/db implementation for the recommandations output page, as well as all the js and most of the html for recommendations input. Additionally, I did a lot of the implementation for heroku, the database, and the server. Wrote most documentation for the final milestone. 

**John Crowley** - Responsible for all the html/js/css/server/db implementations for the workout history page as well as the JS for login page and logout page as well as some HTML. Switched the server over to express and as well as inserted all valid exercises into our database. Wrote the rubric. 

**Victoria Liu** - Responsible for all the html/js/css/server/db implementations for the user register, login(error fixed with help), edit profile, and logout profile pages. Made the final video.Wrote authentication.

**John Laidler** - Responsible for the main leaderboard/landing page and the workout record page including front-end design with html/css and relevant back-end server/database calls for posting workouts and retrieving leaderboard data.

# Conclusion 

Our team learned a lot working on this project. The biggest challenge for this project was linking all the external libraries/services, and the general size of the project. Prior to this, most of us were used to working with a small number of files, and generally not having to worry much about using outside resources. However, for this website, we had to use bootstrap, express, postgresql, and heroku. It took us longer than expected to get all of these things figured out and troubleshooted. While these challenges tested our patience at times, we also learned a lot from them. Being familiar with all of these services is definitely important, even if we never use those exact services again, we are still a lot more familiar with what they do and the general idea of how they work, which is information that is valuable for any type of database or server library. I think the biggest thing we would have liked to know earlier is more info about the database. We had to change some of our data structures and code to make it fit, and some of this could have been prevented had we known more about this earlier. Overall, this project taught us a lot about dealing with larger scale projects and made us better programmers.
