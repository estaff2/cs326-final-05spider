Contributions: 
Ethan - Wrote all code for recommendation output, the recs js,html, and css files. I additionally wrote all related server GET requests for this involving the data from exercises.json, I also wrote the code for nav bar functionality. I also wrote the API descriptions. Due to a last minute heroku deployment the recs server request is currently not working, but will be fixed shortly after the deadline.

John C.- Attempted to write code for workout history html, js, and css. Attempted to add a GET request for user/history as well. Hope to fix and re push following the deadline after working with TA or other resources.

John L.  Handled leaderboard js/html code and server side, as well as posting a workout
